# Example Candidate Proposal

### **Focus area**

**My main focus area** - Development. I have worked as a developer over my career across different teams and companies. Through that experience I have taken user defined problems through to end solutions and have regularly helped taking problems from data modelling through to final implementation.&#x20;

My developer background was in frontend development (Github provided below). I intend to spent most of my time supporting in this area and helping to turn user flows and designs into frontend implementations that support the ongoing development of the prioritised Catalyst features.

As part of my role I would expect to be communicating with product contributors, community members and end users on a regular basis to pull together all the information and feedback needed to create the best experience possible for the community.

**Focus areas I may also support**

1. Product - I have worked in a number of startups which meant I was closely involved with taking problems through to implementation and have a sufficient level of experience of prioritising problems and helping support team decisions for making the right solutions.

### **Contributions**

**Catalyst roles** - I have been a community advisor twice, during fund 5 and fund 6. I was also veteran community advisor for fund 6.&#x20;

**Development** - I developed the contributors list available at [projectcatalyst.org](https://projectcatalyst.org) which was an initial attempt to help bring the community together and increase collaboration by letting people find others based on services or skills they can offer.&#x20;

**Coordination** - I have hosted over 5 after town hall sessions discussing issues surrounding Catalyst and looked for feedback on ways to resolve them, these conversations helped lead to changes and improvements to the Catalyst ecosystem. You can find some of those conversations on the Catalyst Swarm Youtube recordings.

**Analysis** - I drafted out the need for the Cardano Contributors League as I saw an issue with the alignment and collaboration issues that a proposal process can cause and how maximising alignment of the core ecosystem was vital for long term success. You can find the documentation here at [Cardano Contributors League](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/cardano-contributors-league/).&#x20;

****

### **Budget**

**Budget requested** - **** $45,000

**Budget reasoning** - My background as a developer give me enough skills and experience to effectively perform in the focus area of development at a senior level. I have provided evidence of my history in the ecosystem and the development work I have bee involved with to support the evolution of the Catalyst ecosystem.
