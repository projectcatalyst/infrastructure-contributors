### Notes

A minimum threshold of 16 contributors is allocated above. There will be a minimum of 16 contributors which means there could be anywhere from 0 to 8 contributors who could be placed into any of the focus areas once the minimum thresholds are met. Most contributors will not request the maximum budget range and due to that it is likely there are at least 3 to 5 contributors who will be placed into any of the focus areas above the minimum thresholds.



### Quantity needed

**Development**: High - The ecosystem has an increasing amount of complex core functionality required which warrants the need for a large number of developers.

**Coordination**: High - A large number of ecosystem projects and proposals are introduced each funding round that require coordination and support. Online meetings are an important way for the community to connect.

**Analysis**: Low - Some analysis is needed on the ecosystem and proposals to give a good overview of issues and solutions available in the ecosystem. Analysis is not needed at all times in every part of the ecosystem.

**QA & Auditing**: Medium - QA should occur within development teams but could also be checked by a QA contributor. Support on auditing will be valuable in the short term to help gage how to automate the process more and potentially ways to incentivise the ecosystem to be more self governing.

**Marketing**: Low - The marketing focus area will look to bring together the data and proposals that help with the marketing of the ecosystem to bring more synergy to those efforts. Only a low amount of contributors should be needed initially to support this collaboration. The quantity could increase over time if the contributors collectively believe they will be effective in representing a larger amount of the marketing within the ecosystem.

**Product**: Low - A small amount of contributors focussed on product will help to provide structure and support between the developers, analysts, designers and wider community. It would be expected that any development focussed contributors would support in the planning and time allocation.

**Design**: Low - A number of design elements are needed to create better consistency in the ecosystem which over time should be reusable. Only a small number of design contributors should be needed to support the ecosystem initially.
