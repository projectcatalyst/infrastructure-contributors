# Responsibilities

### Combined responsibility

A team of contributors should be able to cover the following combined areas of responsibility to support the growth and evolution of the Catalyst ecosystem.



**Support** - Provide support for proposal teams, community advisors and voters on any part of the funding process. Contributors should be able to answer questions, provide technical support and make suggestions to those that need help.

**Coordinate** - Bring the community together to collaborate on issues and successes within the ecosystem. Help bring proposal teams together to bring more alignment and collaboration where possible instead of duplicated efforts.

**Govern** - Supporting the ecosystem by making decisions collectively about the implementations and processes for the ecosystem. The wider community should be included into any important governance decisions, especially those that may directly impact them such as parameter changes or for deciding where resources should be allocated.

**Develop** - Bring together data, analysis and feedback to guide execution of new processes and development of technical implementations that drive the ecosystem forward.

**Maintain** - Manage ecosystem parameters and services to ensure the ecosystem is reliable. Keep documentation up to date and widely available.

**Delegate** - Delegate work to community members and support existing projects to help to improve the ecosystem.



### Focus areas

[Focus areas](focus-areas/) help group together related skills and tasks. Contributors select a focus area so that the ecosystem has better guarantees it has the needed diversity of talent for the ecosystem.

The aggregate of the [focus areas](focus-areas/) bring in the required talent to cover the responsibilities detailed above.



### Shared tasks

Focus areas help to group similar skilled tasks together so people can be incentivised for the skill and type of work they will mostly be performing.

More generally contributors are incentivised help to ensure the Catalyst ecosystem is performing to its highest potential. The following is a list of impactful tasks to help achieve this and can be performed by any contributor regardless of their chosen focus area.



**Support**

* Provide support to wider community members with any questions or technical support.
* Support new proposals with suggestions for improving their proposal structure, information they have covered or their communication style.
* Provide guidance and any relevant ecosystem data to community advisors to help improve overall assessment quality.



**Coordinate**

* Help newcomers to the ecosystem understand the resources available and roles they are able to get involved with.
* Host meetings to bring the community together on a given topic, idea, concern or success.
* Encourage and support community members that are considering becoming a contributor.
* Encourage similar proposal teams or initiatives to come together when there is duplicated efforts that would benefit from more synergy and alignment.
* Share ecosystem projects and releases to keep the community up to date with changes to the ecosystem.
* Create online and local events and activities that help to bring the community together.



**Govern**

* Gather and present all information required around governance decisions to inform the voting participants who are involved.
* Help provide feedback and vote on problem prioritisation and selection of solution approaches that help to evolve and improve the ecosystem.
* Engage and get feedback with the community to determine where decisions need a wider amount of voter participation.
* Conduct governance of decisions for the ecosystem and encourage the suitable people from the community to participate.



**Develop**

* Gather and present ecosystem data and analysis to help provide suggestions for future ecosystem improvements.
* Invite opinions and feedback from the community to support future suggested changes to the ecosystem.
* Support testing and walk throughs of new implementation features or processes.



**Maintain**

* Maintain documentation, content and resources that keep the community informed and up to date about the ecosystem.
* Monitor ecosystem processes, systems and data to ensure ecosystem is functioning correctly.
* Review progress and KPI reports of funded proposals to ensure progress is being made.
* Audit proposal team execution to ensure expected quality thresholds are met.



**Delegate**

* Help improve support for multiple language by delegating translation work around core resources and documents to support the growing international community.
* Support and delegate funds through a governance process to teams that can help to further develop and maintain services within the Catalyst ecosystem.
