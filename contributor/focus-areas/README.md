# Focus Areas

Focus areas provide clarity to contributors and the wider community by letting everyone else know what area the contributor intends to help with when they contribute to improving the Catalyst ecosystem. Voters get clarity when voting as they will know who they want to fill certain roles within the ecosystem.

Contributors select a focus area to indicate where they will spend the most time supporting the ecosystem. Selecting a focus area does not mean the contributor can't help in the other areas. It instead simply means they will look to spend the majority of their time in that selected focus area.

For each given funding round [budget ranges](budget-ranges.md) and [minimum thresholds](minimum-thresholds.md) are added to guide contributors making a good proposal and to ensure there's enough of each skill set in each contributor cohort.



## Selected focus areas

The following are the initial focus areas for contributors to select from. Other future considerations are discussed below in the [future potential focus areas](./#others-areas-to-consider).

****

### **Development**

**Objective** - Develop and maintain the ecosystem systems and services and also support the community on a technical basis.

**Tasks**

* Research technical implementation options
* Define technical requirements
* Architect features (Data model, tech stack, protocol design)
* Develop and maintain features
* Audit other proposal teams development plans or implementation
* Coordinate technical efforts
* Host technical discussion meetings
* Write technical documentation
* Provide community technical support&#x20;



### **Coordination**

**Objective** - Maximise the collaboration and coordination within the ecosystem and support the community with collaboration, organisation, education and events.

**Tasks**

* Align proposal teams and support collaboration
* Support the improvement of proposals writing and communication
* Collect details on problems within community
* Run community events and meet ups
* Host topic based collaboration meetings
* Help manage an ecosystem calendar
* Support translations and coordinate with global communities
* Help educate community members about the ecosystem
* Provide community general support



### **Analysis**

**Objective** - Research and analyse the ecosystem tools and services and produce data points, reports and documentation that help guide the future development of the ecosystem. Help ensure other contributors have the information they need to maximise their impact.

**Tasks**

* Analyse and give feedback to proposals and challenge setting
* Conduct ecosystem research, problem outlining and analysis
* Collect and aggregate community feedback
* Aggregate, data model and report on ecosystem analytics&#x20;
* Audit proposal teams plans and execution
* Research, define and maintain ecosystem processes
* Research and report on other ecosystems
* Host meetings on problems, research or findings from analysis
* Write and maintain ecosystem documentation&#x20;



### **QA & Auditing**

**Objective** - Help with quality assurance testing on changing ecosystem functionality to ensure releases are to a high quality. Support in the development of new processes and reporting so proposal teams can demonstrate their impact. Help the community with support on auditability and with auditing and flagging proposals.

**Tasks**

* Research, support and flag proposals that require review
* Test implementation features prior to release
* Create and document QA process plans
* Research QA best practices for core ecosystem features
* Research auditing best practices for proposal teams
* Review proposal team audit reports for feedback and flagging
* Manage and improve progress and KPI audit reporting processes
* Host meetings on QA & auditing process, improvements and results



### **Marketing**

**Objective** - Bring together, host events and provide support to the marketing efforts from across the ecosystem to bring better alignment, data driven results and report evidence on the impact of the combined efforts that promote the ecosystem.

**Tasks**

* Share and promote ecosystem solutions
* Support marketing focussed proposals
* Aggregate and report on marketing analytics data
* Support the creation of design marketing materials
* Support event organisation and promotion
* Conduct market research
* Write and proofread marketing copy
* Research and produce creative content
* Provide guidance to proposals around marketing
* Host meetings on marketing approaches and results



### **Product**

**Objective** - Research, collate and get consensus on the highest priority problems within the ecosystem to then help guide solutions that solve those problems whilst maintaining a high quality user experience. Help contributors come to alignment in how to implement solutions and work with the community to bring in feedback and data to support product direction through both contributor and community led governance.

**Tasks**

* Lead efforts on problem sensing, problem prioritisation, solution research and solution implementation planning
* Engage with contributors and community to define product strategy and roadmap
* Conduct research and analysis on similar products and ecosystems
* Communicate with community all product plans, timelines and releases
* Research and improve product development workflows
* Draft ecosystem functionality implementation plans
* Research and analyse industry user experience developments and best practices
* Gather product feedback and analyse results
* Aggregate and report on product analytics data
* Host meetings around problem sensing, prioritisation and solution approaches
* Provide guidance to proposals around product direction and existing ecosystem solutions or product plans



### **Design**

**Objective** - Design graphics, layouts and optimise user flows to create a high quality user experience for the community. Help contributors with maintaining consistency and alignment of the visual design and user experiences of all the ecosystems tools and services.

**Tasks**

* Create design concepts, graphics and layouts
* Create and maintain style guides, icons and illustrations
* Create wireframes and visualise product user flows
* Gather user feedback and iterate designs where needed
* Support research on industry user experience developments and best practices
* Review final layouts and implementations to suggest any improvements
* Support online and local events with design material
* Support and provide feedback on design to proposal teams
* Host design discussion meetings



## Potential future focus **areas**

The following are other options to consider that could become focus areas in the future.&#x20;

****

**Education**

Many of the existing focus areas can support the education of the core ecosystem. Those tasks include writing documentation relevant to what each contributor is working on and also hosting meetings with other contributors and the wider community. Coordination, design, product and marketing focus areas are well suited for helping create visual education aids to support education. If there is difficulty maintaining ecosystem educational resources a group of full time education contributors could be considered that would solely focus on educational materials, sessions and generally supporting the community.

****

**Human resources**

The role of dealing with who is and isn't a full time contributor will be dealt with by the community governance vote. Initially through general voters and then potentially in the future refined down to engaged community members to make it more scalable and simplify the process. If a contributor does not perform or produces conflict with others they are likely to not secure future funding so managing contributors from a human resources perspective could be fairly self governing. Depending on the issues faced from funding contributors directly in the future a more full time human resource contributor could be considered to resolve and manage these issues. Alternatively this role could end up being achieved under a form of auditing role that is fulfilled by community members at the end of contributor funding terms with the right incentive models in place.



**Finance**

Contributors would be funded directly from the treasury initially in six month terms. This helps makes the initial process need little oversight. However the core ecosystem will have other costs such as server costs or usage of SaaS tools to help the contributors work effectively. Managing these costs could be done through a governance process done by contributors using a shared funding pot. If the complexity of managing a shared funding pot increases over time it will make sense to explore the usage of a finance focus area so that these concerns become better managed.
